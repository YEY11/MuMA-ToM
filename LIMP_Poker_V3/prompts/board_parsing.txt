You are analyzing a Texas Hold'em poker broadcast frame. Extract game state as JSON.

## IMPORTANT: Frame Type Detection

First, determine the frame type:
1. **Standard Game Frame**: Has the player info UI bar at the bottom (showing player names, cards, stacks, action labels)
2. **Transition Frame**: Shows only logos, advertisements, presenter closeups, or card dealing closeups WITHOUT the standard UI bar
3. **Card Closeup Frame**: Shows real cards on the table in closeup (may appear during phase transitions)

If this is a TRANSITION or NON-STANDARD frame (no player UI bar visible):
- Set "frame_type": "transition"
- Set "phase": "Unknown"
- Set all other fields to null
- Do NOT guess the phase!

## Phase Detection Rules (for Standard Game Frames)

**STEP 1: Count the ACTUAL CARD images** in the community card area (center of screen).
Only count REAL cards with visible rank/suit. Do NOT count:
- HSD Logo placeholders (red cards with HSD logo)
- Empty card slots
- Face-down cards

**STEP 2: Determine phase based on card count:**
| Card Count | Phase |
|------------|-------|
| 0 | Pre-flop |
| 3 | Flop |
| 4 | Turn |
| 5 | River |
| 5 + showdown indicators | Showdown |

**STEP 3: Verify consistency:**
- `community_cards_count` MUST match `phase`
- If count is 4, phase MUST be "Turn" (not River!)
- If count is 3, phase MUST be "Flop" (not Turn!)

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Count cards CAREFULLY - the difference between 3, 4, and 5 cards determines the phase
2. If you cannot clearly count cards, set phase to "Unknown"
3. Showdown requires EXPLICIT indicators (winner announced, pot awarded)

## Action Detection

Look for action labels near player names:
- Common actions: "FOLD", "CHECK", "CALL X", "BET X", "RAISE TO X", "ALL-IN", "3-BET TO X"
- Extract the action text and amount if visible

## Position Detection (Heads-Up / 2-Player)

This is a heads-up (2-player) Texas Hold'em game. Position rules:
- **SB (Small Blind)**: The player with the "D" (Dealer button) marker near their name. In heads-up, the dealer is also the small blind.
- **BB (Big Blind)**: The player WITHOUT the "D" marker.

Look for the "D" symbol in a circle near one player's info panel to identify the dealer/SB.

## Card Notation
Use standard notation: Rank + Suit
- Ranks: A, K, Q, J, T (for 10), 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
- Suits: h (hearts ♥), d (diamonds ♦), c (clubs ♣), s (spades ♠)
- Examples: "Ah" = Ace of hearts, "Tc" = 10 of clubs, "9s" = 9 of spades

Output ONLY the JSON object, no markdown code blocks or additional text.
